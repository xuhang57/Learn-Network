## Introduction to Networks

### What is a Network

#### The Local Area Network (LAN)

* Usually restricted to spanning a particular geographic location like office or home.
* A big LAN can be split into logical zones known as **workgroups**.
* A **router** can connect to different LANs together so clients from  different LANs can connect with each other.

### Common Network Components

* Workstations
  * Often seriously powerful computers that run more than one CPU and whose resources are available to other users on the network to access when needed.
* Servers
  * Also powerful computers and can be known as the network operating system. (File server, Mail server, Web server, Fax server, Proxy server, etc.)
* Hosts
  * Could be referring to almost  any type of network devices, including workstations and servers.
  * TCP/IP speaking, a host mean any network device with an IP address.

#### Virtual LANs (VLANs)

* A VLAN is a LAN that it is not physically built. And you don't have to be in the same geographic location to be connected.
* Using a particular port  that is configured for the LAN workgroup you are a member of -> VLAN membership, and it's got to be configured on a network device called switch.
* VLANs are new workgroups.

#### Wide Area Network (WAN)

#### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

#### Network Architectures: P2P or C/S
